# Coviz
_A time series visualization project_

This is a visualization and time series analysis project using datasets produced by The New York Times and made available freely for non-commercial use. 

The data represents reported cases of COVID-19 by county and state, updated daily [in this NYTimes repo](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data). I last cloned the dataset on 03/27/20.

In this repo you'll find the following:

* **us-counties-covid.csv**: CSV containing case counts per county since the beginning of records for each county, in long format.
* **us-states-covid.csv**: CSV containing case counts per state since the beginning of records for each state, in long format.
* **coviz.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing project code.

My analyses and visualizations are purely for exploratory purposes. This is a work in progress.
